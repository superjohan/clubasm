4th place in the Wild demo competition at Revision 2019.

Requires iOS 12, probably. The demo should work on most iOS devices, although it's only been tested on an iPhone X.

The demo is about 95% UIKit (the iOS user interface library) content-wise, although this demo only scratches the surface of what's possible. The middle bit uses SceneKit.

This was an unusually tough demo to piece together, due to the large amount of content, and my inexperience with "real" 3d (as evidenced by the middle part). The process was also not helped by me being sick on the week of Revision. Could've been much better, but a general lack of time and ideas is always a hindrance. Britelite was gonna do more background shaders for me too, but he was busy with his game and well, I was busy finishing the rest of the demo.

Thanks to everyone that helped.

CLUB ASM uses [the Inter typeface](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson extensively.

Shout outs to BÃ¼ro Destruct, Oh No Type Co, The Pyte Foundry, and the many others who either influenced the demo or had their stuff stolen by me. I'm sorry.
